# Full-Stack-Arc

This is the of my doccumented Full Stack Devlopment journey. I will using this repoistory to contain and house the different projects I will be working on.

## Working on HTML
When first writing the HTML was very diffcult to how just how connected the **stylesheet** and **Javascript** were.

## Conquering CSS
Writing the style made sense at first adjusting color and size. The typical things you would see in a stylesheet but then you account to **transitions** and **delays** which was very interesting to me.

## Tackling Javascript
Javascript has been a very allusive programming language for me, because it was never a required for me to use. I used getting to use it in conjuction with the **HTML** and **CSS** and the way functions and loops worked.
